# Virtual Fittness Trainer
Our project is “Virtual Fitness Trainer” which guides and helps the person how can he
achieve their health and fitness goals.

Today, fitness and personality are growing areas of interest for a man or woman who
is looking to improve their health. But the challenge is how to find personalized and
easy-to-access fitness guidance. There are many software programs (BodBot and Home
Workout-No Equipment, etc.) that are used to provide a workout or a diet plan, but
these software do not give the best plan for people who have health issues.

Our project will develop a Fitness Training System that provides users with per-
sonalized and free of cost workout plans, tracks, and checks their progress, and offers
professional tips to improve their fitness level and the shape of their body. Our mission
is to make such a fitness training system that provides workout and diet plans for people
according to their health.
